Now you need to setup the development environment. Go organizes the code in what it's called a workspace. Here is a tutorial from Go's website on how to set it up.

As for what to use you have lots of options. All the mostly used editors have very good support for Go, VisualStudioCode has a very good and highly maintained Go plugin. If are a vim user you are in luck, we have a kickass vim-go plugin as well. Atom has very good support too.

If you don't already know git then head over to this tutorials to learn a bit. It will be necessary for this course but also along your career as a developer.
