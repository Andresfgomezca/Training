What is JSON ?

	JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 

	It is easy for humans to read and write as the data is represented in a key/value format. 

	It is easy for machines to parse and generate. 

	It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. 

	JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 28,
    "city": "London"
}

	Above is an Example of a JSON Object with 3 properties:

	name
	age
	city

	Each property has a value.
 

Why JSON ?
 

	The JSON format is syntactically similar to the code for creating JavaScript objects. 

	Because of this, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into JavaScript objects.

	Since the format is text only, JSON data can easily be sent between computers, and used by any programming language.

	JSON makes it possible to store JavaScript objects as text.
 

 

JSON Continued...
 

This is an example of a JSON String
'{"name":"John", "age":"28", "city":"London"}'
The JSON String defines an object with 3 properties.

If we parse the JSON string with a JavaScript program, we can access the data as an object.
{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 28,
    "city": "London"
}
