REST API

	Let's take an Employee Portal for example. 

	An Employee Portal in an Organization must serve the employee data at all times for various internal reasons.

	A basic set of use cases this Employee Portal should target are :

-Onboard a new Employee
-Check the joining data of an employee
-Remove an Employee
-Update Personal Details of an Existing employee, etc.

	Let's take a look at how we can get this Employee portal up and running with the above listed use cases in the upcomming slides.
