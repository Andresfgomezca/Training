SQL VS NoSQL

What is SQL?

Structured Query Language....SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS
There are multiple engines that works under this technologie like
MySQL, PostgreSQL, microsoft SQL Server

There are 4 key components related to databases: Structure, Storage, Scale, Access


Structures:

Tables
	Primary key, attribute, Foreign key
Constraints
	these elements will have an attribute that enforces constraint, the operation will fail if the new element 	is not of the same attribute, this is a great way to enforce consistency in the database

Relations
	we also have Relations between different tables, this characteristic allow us to perform very flexible 	queries

Storage:

Concentrated
	the storage pattern is concentrated, in a relational database engine there is tipically 1 node that contains an entire copy of your data, it's typically not partitioned or segregated in any way unless you're using some advance strategies

Scale:

Vertical(better machine)
	If we have a machine that is hosting our database engine and we are suffering in the performance area the option here is to build a better machine, so have more memory, get a better CPU at a hard-disk, these are ways to vertically scale your machine to get a better performance, keep in mind that there is a physical in therms of how powerful machine we can make, there is a ceiling on vertical scaling


Horizontal(More machines)
	This scaling way just means adding more machines skilled RDS environment we typically perform that by distributing our data across multiple nodes, in this way we can offload pressure in our masternode by reading replicas to ensure optimal performance

Access:
	Raw sequel so writing the raw (CRUD syntax) for our query we typically require a direct database connection to the end point of the database and these days people are using object relational mappers to construct their queries and what these basically are are abstractions that people use to add criteria to an object in a very programmatic way and then allow that to generate a sequel statement that can be run against the engine

**
	These basically cover the 4 pilars of sequel...

What is NoSQL?

	Anything that is non-relational
